# Doodle Jump React.js

After practicing some JavaScript by creating one of my favourite browser games with a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSEsSs3hB6A) 
from the fantastic [Ania Kub√≤w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) 
([code in this repo](https://github.com/thorinaboenke/doodlejump)) I refactored the game into a React.js single page application.
You can [play it here](https://festive-goldberg-7e6a06.netlify.app).

Some of the features: 

- useState
- useCallback
- keyboard event listeners
- game logic (collisions)
- conditional rendering
- array methods
- a questionable colorscheme

## Gameplay
start the game by pressing enter, then use the left, right and up/down arrow keys to move, land on the platforms to avoid hitting the floor
